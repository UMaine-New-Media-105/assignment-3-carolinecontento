set the catcher height and width to 50 in the set up function
set the catcher X = 50 and catcher Y = 320 in the set up function 
angleMode(DEGREES) so that the code would be in degrees not radians
created a myCatcher function
used push and pop at the beginning and end of the function 
after push a translate was coded 
this consists of the arms, legs, smile, body, head and eyes 
the body is an ellipse 
the body is filled red
the arms and legs use the rect code 
the arms and legs are filled orangered
the eyes are filled white and are ellipses 
the smile is a half arc and is filled black 
this was then called in the draw function as myCatcher(mouseX, catcherY);
mouseX allows the sprite to move back and forth across the sand
the rect creates the ocean and the background is the sand
